#Design Concepts

I’ve recently been messing around with website redesigns of Seattle record labels, particularly Help Yourself 
Records. Their website is extremely barebones, and I thought it’d be fun to try and make it look a little 
more contemporary and grabbing. The CSS Zen Garden content doesn’t cater to this especially, but that’s what I
think I’m going to go for with my aesthetic.

As far as the orientation of content, I decided not to get too crazy, and actually used Sub Pop’s site as some
basic layout inspiration (https://www.subpop.com/). I also want to try and use Gaussian blurred images in the 
same vein as the Cooper Union site that I used as an example in an earlier assignment. I think low opacity, but 
high contrast, content-containing rectangles over an image will keep things dynamic but also interesting, visually. 
It’d also be interesting to look into how to make the images in the background rotate, like on The Cooper Union’s
homepage (http://cooper.edu/). 

I would hope that a users immediate reaction to the page would be some sort of intrigue. They might not be
immediately tipped off about what the site is for, but they’ll be comfortable, and curious, enough to delve in a 
little deeper.
